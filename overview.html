    <figcaption>Fig.1. An upper jaw example of orthodontics treatment. (a) depicts the orthodontics status before malocclusion treatment, and (b) after malocclusion treatment. We can see that the misaligned teeth in (a), indicated by arrows, has been revised to be aligned in (b).</figcaption>

<p>Malocclusion refers to a misalignment or incorrect relationship between the teeth of upper and lower jaw arches when they approach each other as the jaws close. As shown in Fig. 1, correction of malocclusion is an orthodontic treatment to achieve optimum relations in physiologic and esthetic harmony among cranial structures and occlusion. The treatment involves adjusting facial bones and teeth by aligning and/or extracting teeth. Current manual or computer-aided treatment planning process is laborious and time-consuming as it requires several revisions from orthodontists. Therefore, an effective treatment planning system is essential to help orthodontists to analyze the malocclusion cases, streamline treatment workflow and enhance overall efficiency.</p>
<p>We propose Automatic Malocclusion Treatment Planning Challenge (AMTPC) to promote the application of machine learning and deep learning algorithms in computer-aided automatic malocclusion treatment planning. The main task of the challenge is teeth rearrangement. Specifically, given the point clouds of 32 teeth from a patient, the purpose of the task is to rearrange the teeth to predict the post-treatment alignment of the teeth as shown in Fig. 1. The objective of this task is to analysis the input with deep learning backbones designed for point cloud (e.g., PointNet[1][2]), and regress parameters for rigid 3D transformation from the extracted features. We introduce a baseline methodology of this task, PointNet Spatial Transformer Network (PSTN)[3], as a reference and initial framework support. The predicted results can then be used to assist the orthodontists in planning.</p>
